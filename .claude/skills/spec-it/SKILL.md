# spec-it

Turn `$ARGUMENTS` into a spec a coding agent can build from without follow-up questions, plus mockups that show every requirement and edge case.

```
Idea → 1. Context (no questions) → 2. Product questions → 3. Technical questions
     → 4. REQUIREMENTS.md → 5. Mockups → 6. Check
```

Paths like `references/…` are relative to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`. Output goes to `spec-it/<kebab-name>/`:

```
spec-it/<name>/
├── REQUIREMENTS.md      the one deliverable: intent, decisions, phases, FRs, ECs, assumptions
└── mockups/             index.html + screens, or api.html + openapi.yaml, or cli.html + transcripts.md
    └── assets/          theme.css, fixtures.js, app.js
```

## Rules

1. **Facts are yours, decisions are theirs.** Never ask what the repo, attached files, the web, or a standard can answer. Never decide scope, priorities, or trade-offs for the developer.
2. **Every question must earn its place.** Run the question gate in `references/questions.md` before each one. A detail with a defensible standard default is an assumption (`A-n`), not a question.
3. **No quota.** There is no minimum. Typical runs ask 5–12 questions. Stop when you can predict the developer's next answers.
4. **Ask through the picker** (`AskUserQuestion`; plain numbered text without it). Up to 3 independent questions per call; never batch a question whose options depend on another unanswered one.
5. **Each question shows once,** as the last thing in your message. No recap of it afterwards.
6. **Write state to disk.** After the context step, keep `REQUIREMENTS.md` as the working file: draft §1–2 early, fill decisions as they settle. After a context compaction, re-read it before acting.
7. **Mockups work offline.** No CDN, network, or web fonts.
8. **The check script gates completion:** `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check.mjs spec-it/<name>` exits 0.

IDs: `FR-n` requirement, `EC-n` edge case, `D-n` decision, `A-n` assumption. With modules, FR/EC/A take a module prefix (`BOOK-FR-3`). IDs are permanent: never renumber; retire with "(removed)".

## 1. Context (no questions yet)

Do this before asking anything. Run both lookups in parallel, with fresh-context subagents when available:

- **Codebase scan** (skip if the folder is empty): stack, existing features that overlap the idea, data models, auth, UI kit and design tokens, API and CLI conventions, anything half-built. At most 25 lines back.
- **Prior-art scan** (web search, 2–4 searches): how 2–3 established products or standards solve this; the domain's known hard problems (the things that go wrong in real use); the standard feature set; any relevant spec (RFC, clig.dev, WCAG, payment or privacy rules). At most 25 lines back, with source links.

Then show the developer a **context brief**, at most 15 lines:

```
What I found
- Repo: <what exists that this touches or reuses>
- How others do it: <product A does X, product B does Y>
- Hard problems in this domain: <2–4, e.g. no-shows hold rooms empty; recurring bookings>
- My read: <one-sentence hypothesis of what you want and why> · confidence <n>%
```

Classify the type (UI, API, CLI, mixed) and create `REQUIREMENTS.md` from `assets/requirements-template.md` with §1 and the Context section filled. The hard problems you found are the raw material for your best questions.

## 2. Product questions

Read `references/questions.md`. Work from the riskiest unknown down: is this the right problem, for whom, what ships first, what is out, then the domain's hard problems as concrete scenarios. Record each answer as `D-n` in §Decisions as it lands.

**Switch to technical questions when all three hold:**
- you can write the restate (outcome, user, why now, success, out of scope) in the developer's own words;
- Phase 1 scope and the non-goals are agreed;
- what is left is about *how*, not *what, who, or why*.

Exception: a hard constraint that changes scope ("must run offline", "reuse our Auth0 tenant", "data stays in the EU") is asked as soon as it surfaces, because it reshapes the product questions.

## 3. Technical questions

Only at **fork points**: places where the repo and the standards do not settle it, and the answer changes the data model, a contract, or user-visible behavior. The list is in `references/questions.md` § Technical. Many runs need 0–4. Never ask hosting, CI, framework, or vendor choices the repo already fixes.

**Confirm gate.** One message: the restate (6 lines), then every assumption you took (`A-n`, one line each, with its default). Ask: confirm, or name the ones to change. Fold changes in. Write `Status: Confirmed` on the spec's status line only after an explicit yes.

## Phases and modules

**Phases (always considered).** The "what ships first" product question decides them. Phase 1 is the thinnest slice where a user completes the core job end to end (walking skeleton). If the developer wants it all at once, there is one phase. Every FR carries `Phase: n`. Phase 1 is specified in full; later phases are one bullet per capability in §Delivery plan until `--next-phase` details them.

**Modules (only on signals).** Treat an area as a module only when it meets two or more: different people or vocabulary; owns its own data; useful if shipped alone; would need its own 10+ questions. With 2+ qualifying areas, ask once: one spec with module sections *(recommended)*, or spec the most important module now and outline the rest. Never infer modules from how big the idea sounds. Modules stay in the same `REQUIREMENTS.md` as `##` sections under §Functional requirements, with ID prefixes.

**Size limit.** If Phase 1 exceeds about 25 Must FRs or 12 mockup artifacts, ask which to move to Phase 2.

## 4. Write REQUIREMENTS.md

Fill the template. Every FR has an ID, priority, phase, Given/When/Then, and `Source:` decision IDs; every edge case raised becomes an `EC-n` with concrete fixture values. FRs say what the user observes; technology goes in §Technical decisions. Then self-review once against this list and fix what fails:

- Two statements that cannot both hold; one rule stated twice.
- An FR a developer could build two different ways (missing limit, unit, role, or failure behavior).
- A criterion that cannot pass or fail by observation, or a vague word with no number.
- A role, entity, or flow with no FR; a decision cited by nothing.
- A word used against the glossary.

## 5. Mockups

List the artifacts (screens, endpoint groups, or command groups), at most 12, each with its states, and every EC mapped to a state. Show the list in one message and go ahead unless the developer objects. Then read `references/screens.md` (UI) or `references/api-cli.md` (API, CLI) and build:

1. Write `mockups/assets/fixtures.js` first: every name, ID, amount, and date any artifact shows.
2. UI: write the design direction into §Design direction. If the repo has a design system or tokens, follow it and skip the design question; otherwise ask one design-direction question with ASCII sketches in the option previews.
3. Copy `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/theme.css` and `app.js` into `mockups/assets/`, set the tokens, and run the check until contrast passes.
4. Build each artifact from `references/renderer.md`: with 4+ artifacts and a subagent tool, one subagent per artifact in parallel; otherwise one at a time here. CLI: write `mockups/transcripts.md`, then `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cli-render.mjs spec-it/<name>`.
5. Fill `mockups/index.html` from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/index.html`.
6. UI with a browser tool: optionally run `references/critic.md` and apply its top fixes once.

## 6. Check and report

Run the check script until it exits 0; treat ambiguity warnings as wording to sharpen. Report in at most 10 lines: the path, counts (questions asked, FRs, ECs, assumptions, artifacts), the check summary line, how to view the mockups (open `mockups/index.html`, or `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/serve.mjs spec-it/<name>`), and the next phase if there is one. `node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/export.mjs spec-it/<name>` writes single-file copies for sharing, on request.

## Later runs

- **`--next-phase`:** read the spec, take the next phase's bullets, run steps 2–6 for them only (questions start from what Phase 1 left open). New FRs continue the numbering; earlier IDs never change.
- **`--revise`** (or a change request): record the new decision, update the affected FRs and ECs, re-render only the affected artifacts, run the check again.

## Rationalizations

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I should cover every area, so I'll ask about integrations." | Ask only if the answer changes the spec. "None in v1" is an assumption. |
| "I'll ask which time step they want." | A standard default exists. Log `A-n`; the confirm gate shows it. |
| "The idea is clear, skip the context step." | The context step is where the good questions come from. Always run it. |
| "The idea sounds big, so modules." | Modules need the signals, then the developer's choice. |
| "They accepted every recommendation, great." | Recommendations may be too safe. Your next question should be one they would disagree with. |
